This is my code submission for the coding problem "Trains".

I built the methods around a Graph Class, which keeps references of all the nodes in added to the graph, and a Node class, which keeps track of the individual Node's relationship with other nodes.

To traverse the Graph I used DFS, varying the parameters based on the different types of requirements (ie: most distance, max routes taken, etc).
